    <div style="margin:40px;">
        <div class="tip" id="unit1.1.1">1.1.1. Modern businesses use IT for storing, communicating, searching, analysing
            and accessing all of the information needed to keep a modern business running. This would typically
            include a list of customers, their likes, dislikes and previous spending habits. It would also include a
            list of products, services and prices, as well as current orders and queries. Other miscellaneous
            information would also be included, such as special offers and promotions.</div>
        <div class="tip" id="unit1.1.2">1.1.2. To successfully complete a digital project, you need some capable hardware
            with a high enough specification of memory, processor, storage and network connectivity, to be able to
            run modern software tools. You need some coding skills, although many modern applications and web
            frameworks exist that can produce much of the code for you.</div>
        <div class="tip" id="unit1.1.3">1.1.3. A typical IT project will include multiple tasks. You can keep track of
            which tasks you have outstanding, which ones you are progressing through, and which you have completed
            by using a ‘kanban’ tool such as trello.</div>
        <div class="tip" id="unit1.1.4">1.1.4. Digital projects are subject to numerous risks, and could fail due to
            events such as hardware failure, unforeseen complexity in the design, team members being recruited by
            rival organisations, or even gross errors such as unintentional code deletion!</div>
        <div class="tip" id="unit1.1.5">1.1.5. Before purchasing IT assets it is best to decide what you want to use them
            for, and pay as much as you need to / as little as you can get away with. Don’t just buy the most
            expensive thing you can find and hope that it works for you!</div>
        <div class="tip" id="unit1.1.6">1.1.6. Trello proves itself useful for planning sites, by allowing you to split a
            complex project up into a list of simple tasks. Anyone on your team can then take on one of these simple
            tasks, moving it onto the next list along on the board, until finally parking it on the ‘Completed’
            list. Github lets you do similar things with the actual body of the code.</div>
        <div class="tip" id="unit1.1.7">1.1.7. When designing websites it’s important to keep in mind that user data
            needs to be protected. Security and privacy are of key importance here. All data must be stored in line
            with GDPR guidelines, details of which can be found <a
